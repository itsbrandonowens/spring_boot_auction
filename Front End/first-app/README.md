I developed a full-stack auction website using Spring Boot for the backend and ReactJS for the frontend. The platform allows users to browse and bid on auction items in real-time. Additionally, an admin panel enables authorized users to log in with special privileges to add, update, or remove auction items, ensuring smooth management of the auction process.

The backend is well-structured, featuring robust testing to ensure reliability and stability. To streamline database setup, an SQL import file is included, making it easy to populate the system with auction data. This project showcases my ability to build scalable web applications with secure authentication, role-based access control, and a seamless user experience.

The front-end CSS needs more work, which will be something that I come back too eventually.
